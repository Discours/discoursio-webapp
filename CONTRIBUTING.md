# Contributing

Thank you for helping improve independent publishing infrastructure. Contributions of code, tests, documentation, accessibility work, and reproducible bug reports are welcome.

## Before you start

- Search existing issues and pull requests. For a large or product-changing proposal, open a discussion issue before implementation.
- Use `dev` as the base branch. `main` is not the active contribution branch in this repository.
- Never include credentials, private content, production data, or real user records in an issue, test, fixture, log, or commit.
- Keep the change bounded. Backend contracts, deployment configuration, and product behaviour may require maintainer confirmation.

## Local setup

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev:demo
```

Demo mode is intentionally read-only and does not represent authentication, publishing, inbox, or other service integrations. For integration work, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure services you are authorised to use.

Before opening a pull request:

```bash
npm run codegen:check
npm run check
npm run build
```

Unit tests need no services or credentials. Add a `*.test.mjs` file under `tests/unit/`; `npm test` discovers it automatically, including in subdirectories. The runner starts in `tests/unit/`, so resolve repository fixtures relative to `import.meta.url`, not the working directory. Playwright scenarios under `tests/e2e/` are not part of this command.

For public shell or navigation changes, run the deterministic browser checks used in CI:

```bash
npm run e2e:install
npm run e2e:demo
```

This command starts and stops its own demo server. Leave ports 3000 and 4010 free; do not start `npm run dev:demo` separately. It requires no account, `.env` file, or live backend. The checks cover the public shell, navigation to the editorial guide, and opening and closing the mobile menu after deliberately delaying JavaScript. They do not verify authentication, publishing, or populated feeds.

The historical integration suite remains separate. Run it only against compatible services you are authorised to use, with explicit test-only credentials for authenticated scenarios:

```bash
npm run e2e
```

## GraphQL changes

The local schemas under `src/graphql/schema/` make clean builds reproducible. They are compatibility snapshots, not an assertion about a live deployment. Read `src/graphql/schema/README.md`, change the narrowest schema or operation possible, run `npm run codegen:all`, and commit the generated client changes with the source change.

## Pull requests

A good pull request:

- explains the user-visible or maintainer-visible outcome;
- links an issue when one exists;
- includes focused tests or explains why a test is not practical;
- notes manual verification and external-service assumptions;
- avoids unrelated formatting and generated-file churn;
- updates documentation when commands, configuration, or behaviour changes.

AI-assisted contributions are welcome, but the contributor remains responsible for understanding the change, reviewing the diff, running the checks, and answering review questions.
