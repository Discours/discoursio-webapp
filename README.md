# Discours web application

[![CI](https://github.com/discours/discoursio-webapp/actions/workflows/node-ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://github.com/discours/discoursio-webapp/actions/workflows/node-ci.yml)

The open-source SolidStart web application developed for [Discours](https://discours.io), an independent publishing platform with an open editorial model.

This repository contains a substantial production-derived frontend: server-side rendering, a multilingual reader, feeds and profiles, a collaborative rich-text editor, drafts, reactions, threaded discussions, notifications, inbox UI, image handling, and GraphQL clients. It is useful both as a contribution target and as a reference for teams building public-interest publishing infrastructure with SolidJS.

> **Repository status:** `dev` is the contribution branch. The public services configured by this historical application snapshot are not guaranteed to be available. Use the deterministic demo mode for first-run development. The current website may differ from this codebase.

## Impact and stewardship

Discours has operated since 2015 as public-interest infrastructure for independent journalism, culture, science, and open discussion. As of August 2026, its wider publishing ecosystem has:

- brought together more than 1,000 authors and contributors;
- published more than 4,000 works across formats, including more than 3,000 long-form pieces;
- supported open editorial participation outside commercial platform incentives.

These figures describe the Discours publishing ecosystem, not package downloads or this repository's GitHub adoption. The project is independently maintained, and current public maintenance priorities are tracked in the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) and [issue backlog](https://github.com/discours/discoursio-webapp/issues).

## Quick start

Requirements: Git, Node.js 20.19+ (Node 24 recommended), and npm 10+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/discours/discoursio-webapp.git
cd discoursio-webapp
npm ci
npm run dev:demo
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. Demo mode starts a loopback-only, read-only GraphQL fixture and requires no account or secret. It supports the application shell and empty public states; authenticated and write flows require compatible external services.

To connect your own services, copy `.env.example` to `.env`, set the relevant public endpoints, and run `npm run dev`. Local HTTPS is optional and explicit: install `mkcert`, then run `npm run setup:https` once.

## Development

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev:demo` | Start the app with deterministic local fixture data |
| `npm run dev` | Start against endpoints configured in `.env` |
| `npm run check` | Lint, type-check, and run unit tests |
| `npm test` | Run automatically discovered unit tests; no services or credentials needed |
| `npm run codegen:check` | Verify committed GraphQL types match local schemas and operations |
| `npm run build` | Create the production SSR build |
| `npm run e2e:install` | Install the optional Playwright Chromium binary |
| `npm run e2e:demo` | Check the public shell, guide navigation, and mobile menu against local fixtures |
| `npm run e2e` | Run integration E2E tests against configured services |

The generated GraphQL client is committed so a clean checkout can build offline. The local schemas in `src/graphql/schema/` are compatibility snapshots, not proof of a currently deployed API contract. See their provenance note before changing operations.

## Architecture at a glance

- `src/routes/` — SolidStart file-based routes and server endpoints
- `src/components/` — reader, feed, author, discussion, and editor UI
- `src/context/` — application state and service orchestration
- `src/graphql/` — operations, local schema snapshots, and generated client types
- `api/` and `.netlify/functions/` — feedback, newsletter, and media handlers
- `tests/e2e/` — service-dependent Playwright scenarios
- `tests/demo-e2e/` — account-free browser checks using local fixtures
- `tests/unit/` — deterministic Node tests used in CI

The stack is SolidJS/SolidStart, TypeScript, Vinxi/Vite, URQL/GraphQL Code Generator, SCSS/Lightning CSS, Biome, and Playwright.

## Contributing and governance

Start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md), and the [maintainer guide](MAINTAINERS.md). Beginner-friendly and help-wanted issues should state their scope and acceptance criteria. Please report vulnerabilities through [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), not a public issue.

Discours is independently maintained. Useful contributions include reliable tests, accessibility fixes, documentation verified against code, and bounded improvements to the editor and public reading experience.
